# Indoor navigation solution for the visually impaired

This project presents a application designed to help visually impaired people navigate indoors.
The application was built with flutter and is a distributed system, which through the use of Beacons can map an indoor environment and allow location and orientation information to be provided to the user.
The highlight of this project is the graph approach, which can be presented as an alternative to triangulation, trilateration and other known approaches.
In this version, the beacons used are still fixed in the backend, but future versions may include an interface to add/remove these devices, making them even easier to use

You can see how the application works in the figure below:
