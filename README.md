# Indoor Navigation Solution for People with Visual Impairments

This project presents an application prototype developed to help visually impaired people navigate indoors.
The application was built with flutter and it is a distributed system, which through the use of Beacons can map an indoor environment and allow location and navigation guidance to be given to the user.

The highlight of this project is the graph approach, which can be presented as an alternative to triangulation, trilateration and other known approaches.

In this version, the beacons used are still hardcoded, but future versions may include an interface for adding/removing these devices, making their use even easier
